\title{Remove a Conda Environment}
\usage{
remove_env(
  env_name = "condathis-env",
  verbose = c("silent", "cmd", "output", "spinner", "full")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{env_name}{Character. Name of the Conda environment where the packages
are going to be installed. Defaults to 'condathis-env'.}

\item{verbose}{Character string specifying the verbosity level of the
function's output.
Acceptable values are:
\itemize{
\item \strong{"output"}: Print the standard output and error from the command-line
tool to the screen.
Note that the order of the standard output and error lines may not be
correct, as standard output is typically buffered.
\item \strong{"silent"}: Suppress all output from internal command-line tools.
Equivalent to \code{FALSE}.
\item \strong{"cmd"}: Print the internal command(s) passed to the command-line tool.
If the standard output and/or error is redirected to a file or they are
ignored, they will not be echoed.
Equivalent to \code{TRUE}.
\item \strong{"full"}: Print both the internal command(s) (\code{"cmd"}) and their
standard output and error (\code{"output"}).
\item Logical values \code{FALSE} and \code{TRUE} are also accepted for backward
compatibility but are \emph{soft-deprecated}.
Please use \code{"silent"} or \code{"output"} instead.
}}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{list} representing the result of the command
execution. Contains information about the standard output, standard error,
and exit status of the command.
