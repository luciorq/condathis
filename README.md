```

### Installing the development version

``` r
remotes::install_github("luciorq/condathis")
# or
pak::pkg_install("github::luciorq/condathis")
```

## Motivation

One of the main disadvantages of calling CLI tools within `R` is that
they are system-specific. This affects the replicability of your code,
making it dependent on the system it’s run on. Additionally, using
multiple CLI tools increases the likelihood of encountering version
conflicts, where different tools require different versions of the same
library. Therefore, relying on system-specific tools within `R` is
generally not recommended.

The package `{condathis}` lets you call CLI tools within R while keeping
things reproducible and isolated.

This means you can use `R` alongside other tools without the drawback of
having system-specific code. It opens up the possibility of creating
code and pipelines in `R` that integrate multiple CLI tools. This is
especially useful for bioinformatics and other fields that rely on many
software tools for conducting complex analysis.

## Reproducibility: An Example

### The issue with `system`

Suppose you’re writing a pipeline or just a script for some analysis,
and you want to use
[`fastqc`](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) —
a program to check the quality of FASTQ files. You’ve installed `fastqc`
and use `system2` to run it.

The `fastqc` command synopsis is
`fastqc <path-to-fastq-file> -o <output-dir>`. The output directory is
where `fastqc` saves its quality control reports.

``` r
fastq_file <- system.file("extdata", "sample1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz", package = "condathis")
temp_out_dir <- file.path(tempdir(), "output")

system2(command = "fastqc", args = c(fastq_file, "-o", temp_out_dir))
```

The `fastqc` program generates several output files, including a zip
file that is 424KB in size. To get information about one of the output
files, we can use:

``` r
library(fs)
library(dplyr)

file_info(fs::dir_ls(temp_out_dir, glob = "*zip")) |>
  mutate(file_name = path_file(path)) |>
  select(file_name, size)
```

``` r
fastq_file <- system.file("extdata", "sample1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz", package = "condathis")
temp_out_dir <- file.path(tempdir(), "output")
condathis::create_env(packages = "fastqc==0.11.2", env_name = "fastqc-0.11.2")
condathis::run("fastqc", fastq_file, "-o", temp_out_dir, env_name = "fastqc-0.11.2")

library(fs)
library(dplyr)

file_info(fs::dir_ls(temp_out_dir, glob = "*zip")) |>
  mutate(file_name = path_file(path)) |>
  select(file_name, size)
#> # A tibble: 1 × 2
#>   file_name                             size
#>   <chr>                          <fs::bytes>
#> 1 sample1_L001_R1_001_fastqc.zip        424K
```

Now, let’s consider the scenario where you share your code with someone
else or revisit it yourself after a year. There’s no guarantee the code
will run because it relies on a specific CLI tool installed on the
system. In the worst case, it might run without throwing any errors but
produce different results, so you might not even realize that.

The exact same code run on the same system but with an updated version
of `fastqc` (0.12.1 instead of 0.11.2) generates a different file, and
its size is different as well: *446k instead of 424k*.

``` r
temp_out_dir_2 <- file.path(tempdir(), "output")

condathis::create_env(packages = "fastqc==0.12.1", env_name = "fastqc-0.12.1")
condathis::run("fastqc", fastq_file, "-o", temp_out_dir, env_name = "fastqc-0.12.1")

condathis::remove_env("fastqc-0.12.1")

file_info(fs::dir_ls(temp_out_dir_2, glob = "*zip")) |>
  mutate(file_name = path_file(path)) |>
  select(file_name, size)
#> # A tibble: 1 × 2
#>   file_name                             size
#>   <chr>                          <fs::bytes>
#> 1 sample1_L001_R1_001_fastqc.zip        446K
```

This discrepancy limits the workflow, pipelines, and scripts to using
only `R` packages!

What can we do about it? We can use `{condathis}`!

The package **`{condathis}`** ensures that the code you share and the
results from running `fastqc` will be **consistent across different
systems and over time**!

### The solution with `{condathis}`

We would first create an isolated environment containing a specific
version of the package `fastqc` (0.12.1). The command automatically
manages all the library dependencies of `fastqc`, making sure that they
are compatible with the specific operating system.

``` r
condathis::create_env(packages = "fastqc==0.12.1", env_name = "fastqc-env", verbose = "output")
#> ! Environment fastqc-env succesfully created.
```

Then we run the command inside the environment just created which
contains a version 0.12.1 of `fastqc`.

``` r
# dir of output files
temp_out_dir_2 <- file.path(tempdir(), "output")

out <- condathis::run(
  "fastqc", fastq_file, "-o", temp_out_dir_2, # command
  env_name = "fastqc-env" # environment
)
```

The `out` object contains info regarding the exit status, standard
error, standard output, and timeout if any.

``` r
print(out)
#> $status
#> [1] 0
#> 
#> $stdout
#> [1] "application/gzip\nAnalysis complete for sample1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz\n"
#> 
#> $stderr
#> [1] "Started analysis of sample1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz\nApprox 90% complete for sample1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz\n"
#> 
#> $timeout
#> [1] FALSE
```

In the output temporary directory, `fastqc`generated the output files as
expected.

``` r
fs::dir_ls(temp_out_dir_2) |>
  basename()
#> [1] "sample1_L001_R1_001_fastqc.html" "sample1_L001_R1_001_fastqc.zip"
```

The code that we created with `{condathis}` **uses a system CLI tool but
is reproducible**.

## Isolation: an example

Another key feature of `{condathis}` is the ability to run CLI tools in
**independent, isolated environments**. This allows you to run packages
within R that would have conflicting dependencies. This makes it
possible for `{condathis}` to run two versions of the same CLI tool
simultaneously!

For example, the system’s `curl` is of a specific version:

``` r
libcurlVersion()
#> [1] "8.7.1"
#> attr(,"ssl_version")
#> [1] "(SecureTransport) LibreSSL/3.3.6"
#> attr(,"libssh_version")
#> [1] ""
#> attr(,"protocols")
#>  [1] "dict"    "file"    "ftp"     "ftps"    "gopher"  "gophers" "http"   
#>  [8] "https"   "imap"    "imaps"   "ldap"    "ldaps"   "mqtt"    "pop3"   
#> [15] "pop3s"   "rtsp"    "smb"     "smbs"    "smtp"    "smtps"   "telnet" 
#> [22] "tftp"
```

However, we can choose to use a different version of `curl` run in a
different environment. Here, for example, we are installing a different
version of `curl` in a separate environment, and checking the version of
the newly installed `curl`.

``` r
condathis::create_env(packages = "curl==8.10.1", env_name = "curl-env", verbose = "output")
#> ! Environment curl-env succesfully created.

out <- condathis::run(
  "curl", "--version",
  env_name = "curl-env" # environment
)

message(out$stdout)
#> curl 8.10.1 (aarch64-apple-darwin20.0.0) libcurl/8.10.1 OpenSSL/3.4.0 (SecureTransport) zlib/1.3.1 zstd/1.5.6 libssh2/1.11.1 nghttp2/1.64.0
#> Release-Date: 2024-09-18
#> Protocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher gophers http https imap imaps ipfs ipns mqtt pop3 pop3s rtsp scp sftp smb smbs smtp smtps telnet tftp ws wss
#> Features: alt-svc AsynchDNS GSS-API HSTS HTTP2 HTTPS-proxy IPv6 Kerberos Largefile libz MultiSSL NTLM SPNEGO SSL threadsafe TLS-SRP UnixSockets zstd
```

This isolation feature of `{condathis}` allows not only running
different versions of the same CLI tools but also different tools that
have **incompatible dependencies**. One common example is CLI tools that
rely on different versions of Python.

## Details

The package `{condathis}` relies on
[**`micromamba`**](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/micromamba.html)
to bring **reproducibility and isolation**. `micromamba` is a
lightweight, fast, and efficient package manager that “does not need a
base environment and does not come with a default version of Python”.

The integration of `micromamba` into `R` is handled using the `processx`
and `withr` packages. The package `processx` runs external processes and
manages their input and output, ensuring that commands to `micromamba`
are executed correctly from within R. The package `withr` temporarily
modifies environment variables and settings, allowing `micromamba` to
run smoothly without permanently altering your `R` environment.

## Known limitations

Special characters in CLI commands are interpreted as literals and not
expanded.

- It is not supported the use of output redirections in commands,
  e.g. “\|” or “\>”.
  - Instead of redirects (e.g. “\>”), use the argument
    `stdout = "<FILENAME>.txt"`. Instead of Pipes (“\|”), simple run
    multiple calls to `condathis::run()`, using `stdout` argument to
    control the output and input of each command.
- File paths should not use special characters for relative paths,
  e.g. “~”, “.”, “..”.
  - Expand file paths directly in R, using `base` functions or functions
    from the `fs` package.
